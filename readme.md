* **Efficient Contact Form:** Provides a straightforward way for visitors to get in touch.

## Technologies Used

* **Styling:** Modify the CSS files or component-specific styles to change colors, fonts, and layouts to match your aesthetic.
* **Component Structure:** Add, remove, or rearrange React components to best fit your portfolio's needs and content.
